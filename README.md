# ErgoChoco-PCB
 My first PCB - a de-split split layout taking my favorite design details from the Corne, Kyria, Absolem, and others.

## The name
 I'm an engineer, and true to form I'm bad at naming things. I'd heard the ErgoDox was designed by a user named Dox, and my handle is Choco, so: ErgoChoco.
 
## Layout explanation:
I love my Corne, but I quickly found that I always orient the halves the same way, making the actual separation and the TRRS cable more of a nuisance, much as I love the concept. So I experimented with angles and settled on 30°. I had also always wondered if I would like more columnar stagger: the Corne seems pretty conservative on that. So after reading the Kyria design log, I took the same approach, made some measurements of my own fingers’ natural resting positions, and discovered they were negligibly different from the Kyria’s, so I lifted those columnar stagger dimensions wholesale. I love the look of the 1.5U thumb keys on the Corne, but I admit it’s always been annoying for keycap compatibility that they prevent me from just getting a Planck set, so I replaced the 1.5U keys with 1U. I picked a somewhat arbitrary distance between the hands that felt like how I would like to set up my Corne if the Pro Micro corners didn’t get in the way. A cardboard prototype with leftover switches/caps stuffed into it confirmed that was a comfy layout for me (and the all-1U thumb arcs don’t look as bad as I worried they would).
